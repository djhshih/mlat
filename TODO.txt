# Development notes

## Shedding weight

osunix.c can probably go...  but it is kept because of the dumpStack and
vaDumpStack functions, which are useful for debugging.  vaDumpStack uses
Unix-specific function calls.

sqlList.c can probably go... but it has useful functions.

Other files with 0% executed code would probably be used if ooc is specified.
