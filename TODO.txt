# Development notes

## Shedding weight

osunix.c can probably go...  but it is kept because of the dumpStack and
vaDumpStack functions, which are useful for debugging.  vaDumpStack uses
Unix-specific function calls.

sqlList.c can probably go... but it has useful functions.

Other files with 0% executed code would probably be used if ooc is specified.


## Differences after using different compilers

Compilers tried:

clang-3.5 (on MacOS; Apple LLVM version 6.0)
gcc-4.4.7 (link against 
gcc-5.4.0
gcc-6.3.0

Code compiles with gcc-4.4.7, but tests are failing severely. Many mlat searches did not yield any results.
Code compiles with gcc-5.4.0 and gcc-6.3.0, some tests show some differences in output.
(Sometimes, compiled binaries with the same compile also yield some differences in output.)

Using the -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_GNU_SOURCE C flags did not help.
Using -O2 vs. -O3 did not make a difference.

Therefore, program behaviour is compiler-dependent!
